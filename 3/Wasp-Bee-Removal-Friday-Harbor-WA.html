<h2>How To Hire a Residential Pest Control Company in Friday Harbor</h2>
<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>

SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may cause severe damage to structures, office furnishings, artifacts and specimens.

This chapter discusses different techniques to maintain pest insects at bearable levels or to put it simply incorporated pest management (IPM).
