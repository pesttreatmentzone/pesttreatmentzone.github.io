<h2>How To Hire a Residential Pest Control Company in Friday Harbor</h2>
<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>

This combination of IGRs can be efficient in preventing re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may cause severe damage to structures, office furnishings, artifacts and specimens.
