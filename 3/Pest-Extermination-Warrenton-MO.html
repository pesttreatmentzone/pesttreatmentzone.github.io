Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about reducing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management strategies are not able to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>If pesticides are needed, they are selected and used in such a way that prevents interfering with other IPM practices. Practically every type of pest postures a threat to the residential or commercial properties they inhabit, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
<p>Since the term IPM has actually been coopted by the chemical industry to imply virtually anything a practitioner wants it to indicate, Beyond Pesticides has accepted the phrase Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management much better represents the focus professionals require to have -emphasizing the broader ecology of pest management and preventing hazardous chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
