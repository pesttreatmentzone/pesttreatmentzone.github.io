<p>Recent research studies document the need for continued decreases in harmful pesticide use and practices. Although the fundamental parts of IPM are always the exact same, the specific aspects of an IPM program differ from one environment or situation to another. Application of predatory termites versus thrips in potted plants is more reliable when done before spacing the plants.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be really efficient in triggering significant decreases in pest populations in specific circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural opponents or saving natural opponent populations by offering sanctuaries or avoiding practices that harm them are some of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>

Assessment is frequently one of the most important actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of examining an IPM program and the outcomes it has created.</p>
