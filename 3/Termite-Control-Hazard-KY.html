<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest issues, classical biological control approach is typically utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has actually been efficiently used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>An extensive understanding of basic IPM concepts and different management alternatives for all possible pest problems is essential as some are preventive and others are curative. We generally recommend pest control chemicals that get the job done using the least quantity of item. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last option).
