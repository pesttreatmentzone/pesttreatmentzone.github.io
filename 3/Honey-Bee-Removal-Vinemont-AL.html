The Indian Pest Control Association (IPCA) is a non-profit trade association of professional pest management companies in USA. Chemical control usually describes the use of synthetic chemical pesticides (Pimental 2009 ). However, to be technically accurate, chemical control needs to consist of synthetic chemicals as well as chemicals of botanical or microbial origin.</p>
<p>Generally, the main objective of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially developed for farming pest management, IPM programs are now established to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that may disrupt the management objectives of sites such as business and residential structures, lawn and turf locations, and home and neighborhood gardens.</p>
<p>A pesticide is defined as a chemical agent utilized to damage or control pests. Each kind of BT works only on one specific pest (or group) and only on insects that really consume it. Nevertheless, that doesn't imply you can spray it indiscriminately. We are the only company in the state of Georgia to use both infrared and Termatrac T3i technology to determine pests.</p>

<p>Arrange your pest control services at your hassle-free date and time. There are numerous companies focused on pests, but the very best one will be the one that works with the best professionals. This is necessary since a lot of control treatments are specific to particular pests. I advise AIPM for your pest control requires without hesitation.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and dissuade pest persistence consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
