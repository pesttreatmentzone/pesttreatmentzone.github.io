The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has been successfully used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and planned management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use chosen biopesticides with low ecological impact.
