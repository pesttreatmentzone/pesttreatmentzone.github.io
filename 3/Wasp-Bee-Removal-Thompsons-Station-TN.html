<p>Termites cause billions of dollars in property damages every year in the US, eating their way through the wood of services and homes. Quotes on IPM adoption in some crops are given in the Tables 5, 6 and 7 These tables consist of details on direct measurement such as location under IPM or indirect measurement such as influence on reduction in pesticide use, application frequency, or treated location. A specific pesticide may have been registered for a pest on some crops, but not on all. With a team of highly skilled exterminators having shown knowledge, we take pride in offering swift and efficient home pest control services to safeguard your home from pest infestations.</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or routine pests like ants, roaches, or spiders, we will recognize the source of the issue. The goal is to provide a general understanding of the principles of IPM, together with the concepts for application in all crops.

<p>The many varying risks from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their structures and collections.
