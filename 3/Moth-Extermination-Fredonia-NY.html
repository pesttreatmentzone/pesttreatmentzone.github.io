SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, might cause serious damage to structures, office furnishings, specimens and artifacts. Applicators carry out more complex jobs, have the ability to use a larger variety of pesticides, and might concentrate on a certain area of pest control.</p>
