<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off due to the fact that growers were not prepared for such an intercropping plan. If your facility currently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be shocked to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
<p>Understanding what your plants require-- and offering all they need-- offers you the advantage over pests. As the stated goal of an IPM system is to get rid of or a minimum of attenuate the economic impact of pests, efficacy in the decrease of pest populations is a main sign of efficiency of the system.

<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your home uninviting to them. However household pests can also be a threat to your household. When searching for a place to infest, pests choose to hide in a location that offers food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is much easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (numerous crops).</p>
<p>It is also apparent from lots of conversations with growers and pest control experts in California that resistance management viewed as rotating pesticides among various mode of action groups is commonly viewed as IPM, although resistance management is only a part of IPM. Pest control is the policy or management of a species defined as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that impacts negatively on human activities.</p>
