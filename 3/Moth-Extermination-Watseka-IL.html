<p>For some tasks, pest control workers utilize a combination of pest management strategies, a practice referred to as integrated pest management. The foundation of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to weeds, diseases, and arthropods, though disputed by some as a legitimate step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the augmentation of pest control.</p>

<p>The numerous varying risks from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage organizations to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their structures and collections. In these countries, regular usage of pesticides is limited to high value (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly fixated cotton, sugarcane, soybean, and rice.</p>
<p>If, after following scheduled and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply chosen biopesticides with low environmental effect. Expert exterminators utilize different types of pesticides and baits to kill and eliminate pests. Efficient, irreversible corrective actions can then be required to prevent pests from getting in the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>
