<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest issues, classical biological control technique is generally utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).

<p>A method that includes the use of pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars established through conventional breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ).
