<p>More information is needed about food-chain concentration and useful methods of getting rid of destructive impacts of pesticide residues that may stay in the environment after the pesticides have actually served their function. Do not base pest management programs on overall removal of a pest. Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode ruin roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy berries and leaves originating from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds assaulting from the air.</p>

In community, industrial and campus settings, advancement of a composed IPM strategy to develop private obligations, pest action limits, a system of communication and pesticide hierarchy is advised and, in many cases, needed by law.
