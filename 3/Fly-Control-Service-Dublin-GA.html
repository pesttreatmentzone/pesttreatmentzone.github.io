<p>Monitoring and identification reduces the dangers of using the wrong type of pesticide, or using pesticides when other methods will be more effective. The advantage of the fogging pest control approach is that it's considered to be eco-friendly, it's odor free and does not leave any residues that are challenging to be cleaned.

Classical biological control involves presenting natural opponents from a pest's native range into a brand-new location where native natural opponents do not provide control.</p>
<p>It keeps making use of pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and environmentally warranted and reduces dangers to human health and the environment.
