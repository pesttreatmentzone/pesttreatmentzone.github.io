Farming takes on the problem with incorporated pest management. The term pest" describes more than one cause of problems consisting of illness, unwanted insects, termites, weeds, mollusks and nematodes. A number of treatment methods have actually been utilized, including chemical approaches, such as pesticide applications and poisonous gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the materials, using micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized environments, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
