<p>IPCA strongly recommends working with qualified and skilled pest control experts from IPCA Member organisations across the country. Agriculture tackles the issue with integrated pest management. The term pest" refers to more than one reason for issues including diseases, undesirable insects, mites, mollusks, weeds and nematodes. A number of treatment approaches have been used, including chemical approaches, such as pesticide applications and harmful gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the products, using micro-waves, gamma radiation, modified environments, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
<p>They are selected and applied in a method that avoids interfering with other IPM practices if pesticides are essential. Almost every type of pest positions a risk to the homes they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.
