The term pest" refers to more than one reason for issues including diseases, undesirable insects, mites, mollusks, weeds and nematodes. A number of treatment approaches have been used, including chemical approaches, such as pesticide applications and harmful gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the products, using micro-waves, gamma radiation, modified environments, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
