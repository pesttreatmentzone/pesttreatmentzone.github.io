<p>Avoiding specimens from being attacked and damaged by pests is a major difficulty of collection management. Some need long-lasting agreements that cost $400 or more despite the fact that for a lot of pests, a single treatment done well should suffice. When the committee understands the kinds of pests that may go into the building and possibly damage collection products, the next action is to set up an IPPM program to deal with the recognized needs.</p>
