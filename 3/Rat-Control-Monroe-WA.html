The following example explains the six elements of an Integrated Pest Management program used to handle carpenter ants. Focusing mainly on long-term pest avoidance, a successful IPM program uses a combination of control approaches consisting of biological control, habitat adjustment, changes to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>For example, rodents threaten grain birds, yields and snails damage strawberries, potato beetles attack tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplants. In addition to pest control, we also use incorporated strategies to help protect the entire home, including insulation and wetness control services. IPM is generally focused on developing systems based upon non-chemical and biological approaches as much as possible.</p>

Biorrational pesticides, consisting of botanicals, natural products (kairomones or allomones), pheromones along with microbials (Copping 1998, Hall & Menn 1999). While none of these insects is a direct threat to collections, carcasses of large-bodied insects may act as a food source for carpet beetle larvae and mice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, insecticides that are more selective since they are most effective versus insects with particular feeding practices, at particular life stages, or within particular taxonomic groups, are referred to as "biorational" pesticides. Established in 1967, it is the leading association of the expert pest management markets, with over 350 members throughout the country.</p>
<p>Biological Control: Using beneficial creatures such as insects or fungi that damage the weeds. Less focus is put on how natural opponents function and how we can promote their natural effectiveness.
