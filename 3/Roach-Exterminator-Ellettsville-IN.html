Nearly every type of pest presents a danger to the homes they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.

Applying insecticides when natural opponents are not plentiful or are less vulnerable, such as when immatures are enclosed in host eggs, can be practical. Ants are pests around the home because they feed on and contaminate human foods, infest structures, and develop unsightly mounds in yards.</p>
