<p>We historically have actually offered nature short, both in its ability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of environmentally unsound techniques in addition to its array of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the probability that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
