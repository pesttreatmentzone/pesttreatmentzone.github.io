<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage, and minimize danger from pests and pest management tools and methods in a manner that reduces general economic, health, and ecological dangers.</p>
<p>A specific pest can be controlled by specific choices, but they may not all be offered in a particular place, for a specific crop, or within the offered monetary methods. IPM involves using the best combination of cultural, chemical and biological measures for specific circumstances, including plant biotechnology as appropriate. This preparation consists of attention to field histories to anticipate what the pest problems might be, choosing crop varieties which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, choosing tillage systems that will suppress anticipated pest damage while offering the crop the greatest yield potential.</p>
<p>Enhancement through propagation and release of natural opponents is an area of biological control that has gotten much attention in the last few years. This component handles the management element of the new IPM model for information collection, organization, and real actions against pest invasions. This concentrates on monitoring the life cycles and frequency of pests to identify the best pest control approaches for the following and present growing season.</p>
