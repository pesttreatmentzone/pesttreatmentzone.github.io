SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may cause severe damage to structures, office furnishings, artifacts and specimens. Applicators perform more complex jobs, are able to use a wider series of pesticides, and might concentrate on a specific location of pest control.</p>
<p>When pest problems are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control measures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry toxic substances in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>

Research and outreach are an integral part of the IPM model to recognize and expect pest issues, establish alleviative and preventive methods, and successfully disseminate the information through conventional and modern-day communication tools and techniques.</p>
