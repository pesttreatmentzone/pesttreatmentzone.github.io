<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest issues, classical biological control approach is normally used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been effectively used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have been frequently utilizing much of these IPM methods for decades or even generations - techniques such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations prone to pests, or using tolerant or resistant varieties.

Make certain the person who will be applying your pesticides holds a valid picture ID Pest Control Licence.

Planting potatoes well away from the previous year's crop prevents access to required food and the beetles will starve.</p>
