A single finding of any pest in a storage facility during an audit can imply a lot of damage to the reputation-wise and company-financial. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your belongings with harmful chemicals, damage the air quality in your house or business, possibly contaminate food and other perishables, and only kills pests at the surface of the problem.</p>
<p>Think about alternative methods (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a building. Current quests for reliable, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted primarily towards advancement of new and better products with which to change traditional poisonous pesticides.</p>

Ecological Pest Management better represents the focus practitioners require to have -stressing the more comprehensive ecology of pest management and preventing toxic chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
