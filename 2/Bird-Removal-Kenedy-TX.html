To deplore an effective IPM programme, literature and other information sources about the pest, the pest's life process, host range, distribution, movement, and basic biology will need to be researched.</p>
<p>When pest issues are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control steps are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis solutions or its cry toxins in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
