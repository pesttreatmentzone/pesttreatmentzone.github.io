The brand-new ribonucleic acid disturbance (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is used to silence particular genes in the target insect is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Certain biostimulants based on minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stressors, but are used as modifications without any claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These brand-new products or technologies can fall under several abovementioned classifications of pest management.</p>
