A reliable IPM program includes pesticides for avoidance and active treatment. Using entomopathogenic bacteria, fungi, microsporidia, nematodes, or infections, and fermentation by-products of some microorganisms versus arthropod pests, plant parasitic nematodes, and plant pathogens generally come under microbial control (Mankau 1981, Paulitz and Bélanger 2001, Dong and Zhang 2006, Lacey 2017 ).</p>

Earlier models of incorporated pest management (IPM) concentrated on eco-friendly aspects of pest management.</p>
