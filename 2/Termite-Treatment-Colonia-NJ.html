<h3>Why You Need Professionals For Pest Control Colonia NJ</h3>
<p>Biological pest control measures make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial job is to establish acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural enemies helps to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control service technicians even fix structural damage triggered by termites.</p>

Using pesticides to crops, animals, structures or landscapes on a regular basis, regardless of requirement, is not IPM. The reliance on pesticides as a sole approach of control has led to the advancement of insect resistance and unfavorable impacts on human health, natural opponents, and the environment.</p>
