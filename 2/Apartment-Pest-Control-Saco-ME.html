<h3>The Importance of Pest Control Saco ME</h3>
<p>Physical and mechanical controls eliminate a pest directly, block pests out, or make the environment inappropriate for it. Traps for rodents are examples of mechanical control. After finishing the required training, employees can supply monitored pest control services. Using physical barriers such as row covers or trenches avoids insects from reaching the crop.</p>
<p>The concept of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable technique for handling pests, has been in practice for a long period of time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt toxins are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Freezer is likewise considered a physical control and, although it does not necessarily kill the insect pests, it at least stops their development and further feeding on the stored crop.</p>
