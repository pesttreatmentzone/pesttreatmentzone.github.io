Integrated pest management (IPM) is a strategy that prevents pest damage with minimum adverse influence on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control home bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about lowering pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management techniques are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and scheduled management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use selected biopesticides with low ecological impact. Expert exterminators use different types of baits and pesticides to kill and get rid of pests. Efficient, irreversible corrective actions can then be taken to prevent pests from entering the structure and infesting the building and collections.</p>
