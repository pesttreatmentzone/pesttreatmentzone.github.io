D's has been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control in addition to fertilizer treatment.

<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest concerns, classical biological control method is typically used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).

<p>Effective, less dangerous pest controls are chosen first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Examination is often among the most essential actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of evaluating an IPM program and the results it has produced.</p>
