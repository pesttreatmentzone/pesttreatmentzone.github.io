IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will guarantee beneficial economic condition, environmental and social consequences 13 and applies to most agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations.</p>
<p>IPM methods consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dosage when other approaches of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat control, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>Pesticides are selected and used in a manner that decreases their possible harm to individuals, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is more than likely to be misconstrued as pest management without chemicals which in reality need based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or packaging, and the facility itself will draw in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
