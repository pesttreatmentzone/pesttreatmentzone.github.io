<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in a natural system are as hazardous to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control specialists can only do so much to secure the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators need to take an active function in incorporated pest management by working carefully with the specialists.</p>
<p>Employing pest control services imply that safety comes first. Using pest management and tracking techniques will also guarantee the decrease of crop loss or damage by pests. Typically infestations of these two types of insects do not need repetitive pesticide applications. Pest control operators, buildings, farmers and premises managers, wildlife management specialists, crop experts and others can have their service or products certified under a range of programs that utilize IPM as a requirement.</p>
<p>In many cases, they will be. If so, an application of a nonselective insecticide might eliminate them, allowing the pest population to rebound uninhibited by predators and parasites, which might have been providing significant control. The pest control market is only beginning to understand the opportunities to improve our business with social and mobile innovation-- however the possibilities are limitless.</p>
