<p>Normally, the main objective of IPM programmes is on farming insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, originally established for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now established to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that might disrupt the management objectives of sites such as industrial and residential structures, yard and turf locations, and home and neighborhood gardens.</p>
<p>However, we can definitely shed some light on the path to reliable pest control. Using insecticides when natural enemies are not abundant or are less susceptible, such as when immatures are encased in host eggs, can be useful. Ants are pests around the home since they feed on and infect human foods, infest structures, and construct unpleasant mounds in lawns.</p>
