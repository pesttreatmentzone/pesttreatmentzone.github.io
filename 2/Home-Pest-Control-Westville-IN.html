<p>These specialists have various pest control plans for each category of pests.

Numerous insect pest species now have resistance to some or several types of insecticides, and couple of chemical control alternatives exist for these pests.</p>
<p>When pest issues are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control measures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry contaminants in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
<p>Using natural enemies as an alleviative control is less effective compared to applying them preventively.
