<p>At the same time, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are fended off or deterred away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide problems are triggered by a small number of the pesticides available today.</p>
<p>Pest control is an incredibly important procedure owing to the reality that a variety of pests are providers of harmful disease-causing microorganisms. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the obliteration of a couple of pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).
