<p>Each time the crop is hunted, record arthropod pest numbers, location within the greenhouse, and the variety of plants examined. It's possible that the repeated usage of pesticides might be more unsafe in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these limits change for changes in market value, phase of crop growth, expense of pesticides, and so on, but in reality most are based upon fixed infestation or damage levels.</p>
