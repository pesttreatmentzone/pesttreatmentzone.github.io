<p>Biological pest control procedures take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes initial task is to establish acceptable pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the limits are crossed.

Some termite control specialists even fix structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>Action Pest Control provides comprehensive bed bug control services including assessments performed by highly trained bed bug pets and bed bug heat treatments administered by expert bed bug specialists. With more guidelines on pesticide use and a reduction in the number of active components in some crops, there is a higher emphasis on much better understanding of readily available control alternatives (Hillocks 2012 ).
