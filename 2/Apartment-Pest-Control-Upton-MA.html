SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, might trigger major damage to structures, office furnishings, artifacts and specimens. Applicators carry out more complicated jobs, are able to use a broader range of pesticides, and may concentrate on a certain location of pest control.</p>

British Pest Control Association (BPCA) is the UK's leading trade association for pest management.</p>
