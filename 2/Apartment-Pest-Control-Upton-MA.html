SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, might trigger major damage to structures, office furnishings, artifacts and specimens. Applicators carry out more complicated jobs, are able to use a broader range of pesticides, and may concentrate on a certain location of pest control.</p>
