<h2>How To Choose a Residential Pest Exterminator Company in Incline Village</h2>
<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Termites are nasty customers. For some jobs, pest control employees utilize a combination of pest management methods, a practice called incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an effective IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though challenged by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the increase of pest control.</p>
<p>IPM methods consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest effective dose when other techniques of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of strategies such as biological control, habitat control, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
