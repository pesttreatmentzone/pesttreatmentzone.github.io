<p>If left uncontrolled, rodents can cause devastating damage to your home and your household's health. The full expression "Integrated Pest Management" (IPM) appeared in press, for the very first time, 28 years ago (Kogan 1998). It needs a skilled approach and tactical attack, which is exactly what you'll get when you get assistance from Pest Control Solutions, Inc For example, by consisting of natural enemies as biological control agents in the management of pests, IPM professionals knew that more particular and less hazardous chemicals would need to be utilized over the long run (Hoy, 1990; Hull et al., 1997).</p>
<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Instruction on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are needed to think about the concepts of IPM prior to using chemicals.
