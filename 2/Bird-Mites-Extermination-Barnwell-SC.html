<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as an entire and takes into account a balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>There are numerous farming practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of integrated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to include all strategies. This chapter discusses various methods to preserve pest insects at tolerable levels or to put it simply incorporated pest management (IPM). Keep animals and kids away from locations where pesticides have been applied.</p>
<p>Prior to signing a contract for pest control, you should be clear about the price being paid, the services being covered and the presence of cancellation charges, Anti-Pesto states. You can use traps to capture particular pests, and barriers to safeguard plants from insect attack or illness infection. Along the continuum, additional non-chemical techniques such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop ranges, mating disturbance, sterilized bug release, etc., may be incorporated into the system.</p>
