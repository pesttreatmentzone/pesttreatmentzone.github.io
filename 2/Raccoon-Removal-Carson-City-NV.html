<h3>Best Exterminators Near Me Carson City NV 89701</h3>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in an organic system are as damaging to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can just do so much to protect the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators need to take an active role in integrated pest management by working closely with the professionals.</p>
<p>As part of the Sustainable Usage Regulation on Pesticides, expert users of pesticides are needed to think about the principles of IPM before making use of chemicals. Biological pest control is a method of managing pests such as insects and termites by utilizing other organisms 8 It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural systems, but generally also includes an active human management function.</p>
<p>You just need to invest an hour on the internet to be overwhelmed by worldwide problems: the vicious circle that develops from making use of big quantities of synthetic fertilizer, which increases dependence on pesticides, which in turn causes resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most important element of artificial fertilizer, phosphate, will practically have actually run out.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies much of the exact same principles as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to lower the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
