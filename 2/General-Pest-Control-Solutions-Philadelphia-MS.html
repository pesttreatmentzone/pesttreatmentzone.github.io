Modern crop varieties frequently unintentionally develop conditions which prefer pest species (e.g., pest species which have bored deeper into bigger fruit making them inaccessible to natural enemies). Anticipate SARS-CoV-2 to act like an intrusive types presented to a new location when resources are plentiful (that is, individuals without immunity) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or registered items to use in management (such as federally authorized medications).</p>
