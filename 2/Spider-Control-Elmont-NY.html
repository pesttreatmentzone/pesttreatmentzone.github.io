Removal approaches consist of usage of animal traps, sticky cards for insects, manual removal of insects from plants (e.g., hand picking or spraying with a hose), getting rid of diseased or infected materials (e.g., pruning branches or eliminating infected litter).</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived poisonous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are regarded as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, similar to artificial chemicals, and possess many of the human and environmental safety dangers as chemical pesticides.</p>

The Indian Pest Control Association (IPCA) is a non-profit trade association of professional pest management companies in USA. Chemical control normally refers to making use of synthetic chemical pesticides (Pimental 2009 ). However, to be technically precise, chemical control must include artificial chemicals in addition to chemicals of botanical or microbial origin.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep an eye on for pests and determine them precisely, so that proper control decisions can be made in combination with action thresholds.

If they can not enter it, pests can not endure without food and will not infest a structure. Another technique includes using baits that either destroy the pests or prevent them from reproducing.
