<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest persistence consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the exact same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
