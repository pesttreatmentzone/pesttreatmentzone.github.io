<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and dissuade pest determination include intercropping (multiple crops in the exact same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>

If the pesticide must be mixed with water, only mix as much as you are going to utilize at one time. A routine pest control treatment of manholes will help to keep those pests away.

<p>Simultaneously, it is also based upon semiochemicals especially kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are warded off or discouraged away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). A lot of pesticide problems are triggered by a little number of the pesticides readily available today.</p>
