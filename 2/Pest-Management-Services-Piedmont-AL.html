This part handles the management element of the new IPM design for information collection, company, and real actions against pest invasions. This concentrates on keeping track of the life process and frequency of pests to identify the very best pest control methods for the current and list below growing season.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, it is also based on semiochemicals especially kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are warded off or prevented away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or removed 35 (Figure 5 ). The majority of pesticide issues are triggered by a little number of the pesticides available today.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production applies many of the very same ideas as IPM however restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
