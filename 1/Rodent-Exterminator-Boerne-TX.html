It requires a professional technique and tactical attack, which is exactly what you'll get when you enlist assistance from Pest Control Services, Inc For example, by including natural enemies as biological control agents in the management of pests, IPM practitioners understood that more particular and less damaging chemicals would need to be utilized over the long term (Hoy, 1990; Hull et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides used in an organic system are as harmful to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can only do so much to protect the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators have to take an active role in integrated pest management by working carefully with the professionals.</p>
