<p>Pest management needs a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after regular tracking shows that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level. Numerous private product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM means for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted locations.</p>
