<p>The best method to control pests is to make your house uninviting to them. But household pests can likewise be a threat to your household.

To reduce prospective harm to beneficial insects, restrict your spraying to little locations where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "havens" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
