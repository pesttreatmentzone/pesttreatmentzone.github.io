Preferably, these thresholds adjust for changes in market prices, stage of crop development, expense of pesticides, etc., however in reality most are based upon fixed problem or damage levels.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived harmful metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, similar to synthetic chemicals, and possess a number of the ecological and human security dangers as chemical pesticides.</p>
