<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived toxic metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, similar to synthetic chemicals, and possess much of the environmental and human safety dangers as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>The success of control strategies must be determined using signs based on monitoring of damaging organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and impact on the environment. These consist of the revival of pest populations after decimation of the natural opponents, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable influence on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
