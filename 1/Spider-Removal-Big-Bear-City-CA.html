A single finding of any pest in a storage facility throughout an audit can indicate a great deal of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your valuables with hazardous chemicals, damage the air quality in your home or business, possibly contaminate food and other perishables, and only eliminates pests at the surface area of the problem.</p>

WorkWave PestPac has exciting new functions being debuted at this year's PestWorld that enable its industrial pest control companies to handle and exceed their client's expectations. For this reason, we have to return after 15-20 days for a 2nd round of pesticides to kill the newly hatched bed bugs.</p>

Chemical controls were to be used only after routine monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the cost of the control steps.</p>
