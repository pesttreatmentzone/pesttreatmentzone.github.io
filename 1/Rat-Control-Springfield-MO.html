We take a look at the big photo and concentrate on long term avoidance of pests by performing pre-treatment assessments, determining conditions conducive to pests, de-webbing, positioning of monitoring devices, sanitation recommendations, prevention & exemption, and using pesticides in a strategic and safe manner are all examples of how Mills PM carries out the practices of IPM.</p>
<p>Current studies document the need for continued decreases in harmful pesticide usage and practices.
