<p>Pesticides are picked and applied in a manner that minimizes their possible damage to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is probably to be misconstrued as pest management without chemicals which in fact need based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or product packaging, and the center itself will draw in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can rapidly accomplish levels at which damage is caused thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare).
