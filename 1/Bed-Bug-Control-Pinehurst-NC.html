Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>The expert user ought to keep the use of pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are necessary, e.g. by decreased dosages, decreased application frequency or partial applications, thinking about that the level of danger in plants is acceptable and they do not increase the risk for advancement of resistance in populations of hazardous organisms.</p>
