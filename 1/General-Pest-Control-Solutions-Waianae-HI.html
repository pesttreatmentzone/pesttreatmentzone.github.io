<p>Each time the crop is searched, record arthropod pest numbers, area within the greenhouse, and the number of plants checked. It's possible that the repeated usage of pesticides might be more hazardous in the long term than the pests themselves. Preferably, these thresholds adjust for changes in market value, phase of crop growth, cost of pesticides, and so on, but in truth most are based on repaired problem or damage levels.</p>
