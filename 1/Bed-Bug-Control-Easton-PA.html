<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove due to the fact that growers were not all set for such an intercropping arrangement. If your center presently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be shocked to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
<p>For example, diesel-powered tractors are run for vacuuming western tarnished bug in strawberry 2-3 times or more each week while a pesticide application normally needs using tractor as soon as every 7-14 d. To control certain pests, several applications of natural pesticides might be needed with associated dangers and costs, while similar pest populations could be managed by fewer chemical pesticide applications.</p>
