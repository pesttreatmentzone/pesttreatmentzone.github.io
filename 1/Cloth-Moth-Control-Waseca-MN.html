D's has been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment.

<p>Monitoring and identification reduces the threats of utilizing the incorrect type of pesticide, or using pesticides when other methods will be more efficient. The advantage of the fogging pest control approach is that it's thought about to be environmentally friendly, it's odor-free and does not leave any residues that are challenging to be cleaned up.
