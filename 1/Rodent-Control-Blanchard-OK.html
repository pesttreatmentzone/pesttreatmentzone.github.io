(2007 ), the idea did not remove because growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan. If your facility currently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be shocked to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact products and services.</p>

Most people usually think of pest control during the warmer months, when swarms of insects try to attack their yards and homes, however, pests understand no season. A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides derived from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally happening materials.</p>
