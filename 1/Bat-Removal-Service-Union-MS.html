Only then can we lower making use of artificial fertilizers, reduce dependence on pesticides and increase efficiency.

You can use traps to capture specific pests, and barriers to safeguard plants from insect attack or illness infection. Along the continuum, extra non-chemical techniques such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop ranges, mating disruption, sterile bug release, and so on, might be incorporated into the system.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep an eye on for pests and recognize them precisely, so that suitable control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds. However, the major pattern has been toward the use of modern chemistry and molecular biology to replace standard pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; but these ways are still therapies.</p>
