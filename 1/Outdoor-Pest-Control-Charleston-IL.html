Do not blend pesticides.

<p>It keeps making use of pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and environmentally justified and minimises threats to human health and the environment. In a metaanalysis of data of 145 research studies, the effectiveness of either parasitoids or predators was demonstrated to be excellent in reducing the number of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>

Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
