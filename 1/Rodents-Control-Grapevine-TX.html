<p>The second worker is an applicator, who utilizes a wide variety of pesticides and might concentrate on a specific location of pest control. Predators eliminate their prey that damages crops, for example, ladybugs lower aphid numbers. In many cases release of natural enemies even before the pest is present is possible, or required for optimum effectiveness. The initial treatment includes evaluations, extermination of existing pests and boundary outdoor treatments.</p>

If so, an application of a nonselective insecticide might kill them, allowing the pest population to rebound uninhibited by predators and parasites, which might have been supplying substantial control. The pest control industry is only starting to comprehend the opportunities to improve our business with mobile and social innovation-- but the possibilities are unlimited.</p>
