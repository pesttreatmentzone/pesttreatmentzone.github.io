<p>Destruction of crop residue: Pupae of bug stays inside the crop residue and can be managed by ruining it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all agricultural crops, but synthetic pesticides remain a dominant strategy in managing pests. Maybe you're the type to dive in, research study your pest, check out the most efficient control alternatives, and are feeling well prepared to take things on by yourself.</p>
<p>The number of plants checked will depend upon aspects such as the value of the crop, potential problems and size and type of greenhouses.

<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also included to divert insect attack far from the crop. Managing pests can be done in lots of ways however an efficient way is to clean out the bugs routinely. In this guide we define standard or chemical insecticides as those having a broad spectrum of activity and being more damaging to natural opponents.</p>
