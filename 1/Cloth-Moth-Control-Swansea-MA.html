<p>Pest management requires a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after routine tracking suggests that a pest population had reached a financial limit level. Numerous private commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM means for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are available in limited locations.</p>
<p>The decision of the appropriate reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively impact natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect types or life phases.</p>
<p>When cotton pest management program was developed, the principle has actually been around since the 1920's. Pest control companies understand the best pesticide to use in any scenario, this saves a great deal of costs.
